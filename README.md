# Apple Victoria

![alt text](assets/readme/mockup.jpg "A mockup picture for the Apple Victoria project.")

["Apple Victoria"](https://shirral.github.io/Apple-Victoria/) is a short game about picking apples created as a project meant to teach me working with Javascript and jQuery. The goal of the game is simple: fill the fruit bins with many apples as you can while maintaining the quality of the fruit! Pick the good apples, drop the bad apples to the ground - and be careful not to mix them up! Your supervisor will not be impressed if you do...

Left click or tap on an apple to pick it; right click or swipe it down to drop it to the ground. Once the tree has been stripped of apples, you will move onto the next tree. It might be filled with apples, or it might only have a few fruits. That happens! 

When you fill a bin, a new one will be brought in. You need to fill a minimum of 3.5 bins. Good luck!
